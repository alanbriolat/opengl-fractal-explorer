Alan's Crappy Fractal Explorer
==============================

Apparently back in 2008 I tried to write a fractal explorer using nothing but
C99, OpenGL and pthreads.  It depends on the usual GL/GLU/GLUT stack, plus
libGD.

Build it with ``make``, run it with ``./fractal``.  The arrow keys pan the
image, the plus and minus keys zoom in and out.  Zooming in to 200% causes a
new image to be generated.

I never finished it, and I haven't touched the code in a long time - how it
actually works is an exercise for the reader.
